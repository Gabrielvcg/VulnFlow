# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-29

- Added explicit independent transactions for scan registration, completion,
  and failure recording.
- Added safe retries for failed scans, deterministic handling for concurrent
  uploads, and idempotent recovery of stale processing scans.
- Hardened Trivy structure validation, request error mapping, upload metadata,
  description limits, and stable pagination.
- Added stateless API-key authentication for `/api/v1/**` and localhost-only
  Docker port bindings.
- Added Flyway V2 for scan failure metadata and the processing-timeout index.
- Refreshed the Terraform AWS provider lock to an available version so
  non-deploying initialization and validation remain reproducible.
- Expanded unit and PostgreSQL integration coverage for retry, concurrency,
  rollback, security, client errors, and recovery.
